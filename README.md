## Features

1. Review every file the agent just changed in the `Diff` panel, with support for both standard mode and PTC mode.
2. Undo support is currently available in standard, PTC, and Creator modes for text edits and newly created files performed by the agent.
   > DSH does not currently provide a file-deletion tool, so this plugin cannot yet undo deleted files. Support will be added once DSH provides such a tool.
3. Add comments to changed lines and ask the agent to continue making updates based on the feedback, or ask questions about the changes.
4. Multilingual support, including Chinese and English.

## Quick start

### 0. Add dsh-file-review in pnpm's minimum release age withlist

Open `~/.dsh/profiles/web/pnpm-workspace.yaml` and add:

```yaml
minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
  - dsh-file-review
```

Recent versions of `pnpm` enforce a minimum release age, so newly published packages are not installed until that waiting period has passed. To install the latest version, add `dsh-file-review` to the exclusion list.

### 1. Install the plugin

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-file-review
```

### 2. Start DSH Web

```sh
dsh web
```

```sh
git clone https://github.com/new-Beginner/dsh-diff-review-likecodex.git

```

## Install from GitHub repository

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:new-Beginner/dsh-diff-review-likecodex
