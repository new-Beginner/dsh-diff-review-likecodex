## Features

1. Supports [DSH Better Sidebar](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar). You can use this plugin on its own or together with DSH Better Sidebar.
2. This plugin supports standard, PTC, and Creator modes, but **does not currently support Minimal mode**.
3. Review every file the agent just changed in the `Diff` panel.
4. Undo edited and newly created files. **Undoing deleted files is not currently supported.**
   > DSH does not currently provide a file-deletion tool, so this plugin cannot yet undo deleted files. Support will be added once DSH provides such a tool.
5. Add comments to changed lines and ask the agent to continue making updates based on the feedback, or ask questions about the changes.
6. Automatically wrap long text while reviewing. Enable it under Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration → File review; it is disabled by default.
7. Multilingual support, including Chinese and English.

## Compatibility

The currently adapted versions are shown in the compatibility badges above. Other versions have not been verified.

## Quick start

### 0. Add dsh-file-review and dsh-better-sidebar to pnpm's minimum release age allowlist

Open `~/.dsh/profiles/web/pnpm-workspace.yaml` and add:

```yaml
minimumReleaseAgeExclude:
  - dsh-file-review
  - dsh-better-sidebar
```

Recent versions of `pnpm` enforce a minimum release age, so newly published packages are not installed until that waiting period has passed. To install the latest versions, add both `dsh-file-review` and `dsh-better-sidebar` to the exclusion list.

### Install dsh-better-sidebar (optional)

> Skip this step if you do not need dsh-better-sidebar or already have it installed. This plugin works without dsh-better-sidebar.
> For details, see the [DSH Better Sidebar installation instructions](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar#installation).
